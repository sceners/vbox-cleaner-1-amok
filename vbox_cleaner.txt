================================================================================
Well, version 1.0 ?  Should be a beta... ;-)

-=[ DESCRIPTION ]=-

This tool is able to detect and remove Vbox files and Registry entries which are
NOT removed during or after the uninstall procedure of a Vbox protected software
product.

These files and/or Registry entries require  hard disk space and do not  have to
be there!

Tested Vbox versions: 4.1, 4.3 and 4.5; other versions might work as well.

Using this tool is very simple. Launch it and click "Scan" to search for Vbox
files and  Registry  entries.   There  are two  check  boxes, but they  are
self-explanatory, I think.

TIP:  To make sure that all files / Registry entries are removed let the program
      scan at least twice.

NOTE: Empty scanned (Vbox) directories are removed automatically, but this does
      currently not work under Win2000.
      The following Vbox directories are scanned:

      <WINDIR>\Vbox
      <WINDIR>\PreviewSoft
      <COMMON FILES>\Vbox
