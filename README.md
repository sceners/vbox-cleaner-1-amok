Well, version 1.0 ?  Should be a beta... ;-)

-=[ DESCRIPTION ]=-

This tool is able to detect and remove Vbox files and Registry entries which are
NOT removed during or after the uninstall procedure of a Vbox protected software
product.

These files and/or Registry entries require  hard disk space and do not  have to
be there!

Tested Vbox versions: 4.1, 4.3 and 4.5; other versions might work as well.

-=[ HELP ]=-

Using this tool is very simple. Launch it and click "Scan" to search for Vbox
files and  Registry  entries.   There  are two  check  boxes, but they  are
self-explanatory, I think.

TIP:  To make sure that all files / Registry entries are removed let the program
      scan at least twice.

NOTE: Empty scanned (Vbox) directories are removed automatically, but this does
      currently not work under Win2000.
      The following Vbox directories are scanned:

      <WINDIR>\Vbox
      <WINDIR>\PreviewSoft
      <COMMON FILES>\Vbox
```
